This library can help fading sounds in and out with AvAudioPlayer. One can set duration and velocity of the fade. Velocity can vary from linear to exponential.

```Swift
cephalopod = Cephalopod(player: player)
cephalopod?.fadeIn()
```

## Setup (Swift 3.0 / Xcode 8)

There are three ways you can add Cephalopod to your Xcode project.

#### Add source (iOS 7+)

Simply add the [CephalopodDistrib.swift](https://github.com/evgenyneu/Cephalopod/blob/master/Distrib/CephalopodDistrib.swift) file to your project.


#### Setup with Carthage (iOS 8+)

Alternatively, add `github "evgenyneu/Cephalopod" ~> 1.0` to your Cartfile and run `carthage update`.

#### Setup with CocoaPods (iOS 8+)

If you are using CocoaPods add this text to your Podfile and run `pod install`.

```
use_frameworks!
target 'Your target name'
pod 'Cephalopod', '~> 1.0'
```


<!-- ### Legacy Swift versions

Setup a [previous version](https://github.com/evgenyneu/Auk/wiki/Legacy-Swift-versions) of the library if you use an older version of Swift. -->



## Usage


The following example shows how to play an mp3 file with a fade in effect.

```Swift
import AVFoundation
import Cephalopod // For CocoaPods and Carthage
// ---

var playerInstance: AVAudioPlayer?
var cephalopod: Cephalopod?

override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()

  // Create player instance
  guard let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "squid", ofType: "mp3") else { return }
  guard let player = try? AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: URL(fileURLWithPath: path)) else { return }
  playerInstance = player

  // Start audio playback
  player.play()
  player.volume = 0

  // Fade in the sound
  cephalopod = Cephalopod(player: player)
  cephalopod?.fadeIn()
}
```

### Fade in / fade out

```Swift
cephalopod?.fadeIn()
cephalopod?.fadeOut()
```

### Set fade duration and velocity

```Swift
cephalopod?.fadeIn(duration: 3, velocity: 2)
```

### Supply fade start/end volume, completion callback

```Swift
cephalopod?.fade(fromVolume: 0.3, toVolume: 0.7, duration: 3, velocity: 2) { finished in
  print("Fade in finished")
}
```

### Set the quality of fade

```Swift
cephalopod?.volumeAlterationsPerSecond = 20
```

Larger numbers will produce finer fade effect at expense of CPU juice.

## Volume functions

The following graph shows how sound volume changes during the fade.

### Fade in formula

### Fade out formula

Where `x` is time and `v` is velocity.

Velocity of 0 creates a linear fade. Values greater than zero produce more exponential fade affect. Exponential fade sounds more gradual to a human ear. I personally use velocity values from 2 to 5.
